            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h3>Random facts</h3>
            <p>I am from Cedar Girls' Secondary school. My CCA right now is taekwondo.</p>
            <p>I travelled in a plane when I was less than a month old. That's why my first passport picture looks so bad LOL.</p>
            
            <h3>My likes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Travelling</u></li>
                <p>I LOVE travelling. The idea of visiting a new country excites me as I love travelling in planes and I enjoy the whole process of packing and going to the airport. I also enjoy seeing new places and learning more about different cultures. I really like scenic and historic places. My favourite continent is Europe because I love their food and their culture. In fact, my dream is to travel the world and live life from different perspectives with my family or friends.</p>
                <img src="https://www.candorblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/travel-022.jpg" alt="Travelling">

                <li><u>Fashion</u></li>
                <p>I absolutely love everything to do with fashion and style. From clothes, shoes, jewellery to accessories, you name it, I love it. Dressing up brings me great happiness because I can feel more confident in things that look good. I'm not one who cares much about brand because I am very stingy LOL so I hate spending money unnecessarily. I think it is good that I'm stingy so that it moderates my shopping addiction.</p>

                <li><u>Chocolate milk</u></li>
                <p>This is pretty self-explanatory because who doesn't love chocolate milk? I really want to try hot chocolate in Paris and Italy and try chocolate milk in New Zealand where milk tastes so good.</p>

                <li><u>Fitness</u></li>
                <p>Rather strange but I like fitness related stuff like eating clean and exercising. I love the sore feeling after working out because it gives me a sense of fulfilment that brings me great satisfaction. I really like running and I used to regularly run 5km last year but I have not had enough time this year to be doing that regularly. But I love walking. I also like eating clean which means I don't consume unhealthy food because I believe that it might affect me negatively when I am older. So in order to keep fit I eat well for my body and exercise regularly.</p>

                <li><u>Summer</u></li>
                <p>I love summer because I love the sun and the ocean. Summer is a happy weather where you can relax in water which is what I love. Summer > Winter because I don't like to wear so many layers of clothes. That being said I also really enjoy water activities.</p>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>My dislikes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Reptiles</u></li>
                <p>I HATE reptiles of any sort. They are scaly, slimy and disgusting. I hate snakes the most.</p>

                <li><u>Foul smells</u></li>
                <p>I am super sensitive to smells so if I smell something bad I feel like puking.</p>

                <li><u>Certain types of food</u></li>
                <p>I am also a very picky eater but I do many vegetables and fruits.</p>
